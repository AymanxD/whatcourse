Project details \
At a given university, courses listed on timetables are solely picked based on time avaiblility with very little information. Often-times, official descriptions of a course are limited to a small paragraph and course information is spread by word of mouth or through attendance on the first day with the syllabus. As a result, students often drop courses and have to rearrange their schedule before the official course drop date (typically two weeks). This application is an user interface where students can sign up, rate and review university courses. Since the appication is user-based, it will be self-sufficient and students will be able to advise other students with a rating system. Specifically, the rating system will assess a particular course based on workload, the professor and the overall complexity. This will enable a user to asses their course selection optimally based on a number of factors.
